# Friday Digital Drinks
**_"If you don't think you have a quality problem with your data, you haven't looked at it yet."_**

Every researcher has experienced one or multiple of the following situations: 
1. A problem that you are not sure how to solve
1. No space to think about new ideas and ways of pushing the research forward
1. having the data but no idea what to do next
1. having the data in a bad shape and no research assistant to fix them
1. need to produce a map for a presentation/article/book

We offer our expertise in various areas related to the typical research data cycle, such as the spatial data capture and their display, data cleaning and manipulation, and the wonderful world of bibliographic reference managers. Our meetings will have a different theme every week, but feel free to bring your own ideas and issues.
